*   Acknowledgement: The project uses Arduino libraries.  
*   The aim is to build a ESP32 based firmware which acquire all sensors:
    1) Optical DO X 1 (MODBUS)
    2) pH X 1         (MODBUS)
    3) MAX31865(For PT100) X 3      (SPI)
    4) BME680 X 1     (I2C)
*   The MODBUSRTU communication protocol is implemented according to Modbus_over_serial_line_V1_02.pdf
*   This program only reads data from multiple slave devices, performs necessary calculations and later sends to the MQTT broker.
*   ESP32 is used for it's versatility.
